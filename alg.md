# Algorithms

## Time Complexity

The time of execution

### Calculate

Remove the constants

### O(1) 

Number of operations is constant relative to the input size.

USUALLY access is instant.

Not always fast, there could be 1000 operations and the time complexity could still be O(1)

## Space Complexity

### In-place algorithm

Algorithm that doesnt require extra space proportional to the input size
